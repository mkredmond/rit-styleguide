                    The program is a supplemental instruction session offered to
                    all RIT students looking for one-on-one help for
                    introductory math courses. The program aims to boost
                    mathematics understanding across campus since all students
                    must take a math course to complete their degrees.

                    As the final phase of the new research building is
                    completed, faculty-researchers from three of RIT’s colleges
                    are preparing to be its first residents. They expect to move
